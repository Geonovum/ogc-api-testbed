# Services

This is the home of the various service components.
Each directory below contains the resources for a single component.
Except the [/admin](/admin) dir, which contains most of the admin stack.

Each service component is basically a `docker-compose.yml` file with supporting resources/files.

Each service can be started individually with `start.sh` and `stop.sh` Bash scripts.
