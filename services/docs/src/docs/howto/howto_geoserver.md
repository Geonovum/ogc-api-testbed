# HOWTO GeoServer

[GeoServer](https://geoserver.org) is a commonly used application server providing webservices based on OGC standards. GeoServer provides a web interface to set up new services, including extended authorisation options. This HOWTO indicates 2 approaches to set up OGC API Features services in GeoServer. Both approaches can not be combined in a single GeoServer instance.

## Dynamical setup

GeoServer can be dynamically configured to add new services. 2 approaches are described:

### Via Web Administrator

This HOWTO describes how you can upload data and set up a new layer on GeoServer via the Web Administrator.



### Via GeoCat Bridge

This HOWTO describes how you can use QGIS to setup a new layer on GeoServer. For QGIS a plugin called GeoCat Bridge is available which 
can publish a GQIS project as a workspace on GeoServer.

We prepared a small [video about the steps involved](https://drive.geocat.net/s/PtNWacEFfP9AN7Z).
