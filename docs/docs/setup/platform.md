# Platform setup

The project repository contains contains components to bootstrap, configure ("provision") and maintain a remote
deployment of an OGC API web-service stack using modern "DevOps" tooling.

![Schematic overview of the platform](../images/schema.png)

## Design Principles

The main design principles are:

* starting point is an empty VPS/VM with Ubuntu and root (key) access
* any action on the server/VM host is performed from a client host
* i.e. no direct access/login to/on the server/VM is required, only for problem solving
* remote actions can be performed manually or triggered by GitHub Workflows
* all credentials (passwords, SSH-keys, etc) are secured 
* two operational stack instances 1) production, *"Stable"* and 2) playground, *"Sandbox"*

## Components

The components used to realize this design are:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) *"...OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers..."* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)))
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) *"...a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications..."*
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) *"...an open-source software provisioning tool"* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)))
* [GitHub Actions/Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) *"...Automate, customize, and execute software development workflows in a GitHub repository..."*
* [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) a frontend proxy/load-balancer and SSL (HTTPS) endpoint.

The Docker-components are used to run the operational stack, i.e. the OGC API web-services and supporting services like for monitoring. 
Ansible is used to provision (bootstrap)  both the server OS-software
and the operational stack. Ansible is executed on a local client/desktop system to invoke operations on a remote server/VM.
These operations are bundled in so-called Ansible Playbooks, YAML files that describe a desired server state.
GitHub Actions are used to construct Workflows. These Actions will invoke these Ansible Playbooks, effectively configuring
and provisioning the operational stack on a remote server/VM. 
                    
Security is guaranteed by the use of [Ansible-Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) 
and [GitHub Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

Traefik manages the routing of remote requests to relevant containers. Traefik listens to Docker Engine to be aware of available containers. Containers include a dedicated configuration which is picked up by traefik to enable the route. 

## Services

A number of services has been deployed within the platform, which can act as a template to add additional services. 

* [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io/) - a Python server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards.
* [pycsw](https://pycsw.org/) - a Python server implementation of  OGC API Records.
* [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) - a Java server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards.
* [ldproxy](https://interactive-instruments.github.io/ldproxy/) - a Java server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards.
* [QGIS Server](https://www.qgis.org/) - server component of QGIS with OGC OAFeat support.
* [GOAF](https://www.github.com/pdok/goaf) - OAF service developed in Go, maintained by PDOK.
* [PostgreSQL/PostGIS](https://postgis.net) - geospatial database

For administration, documentation and monitoring the following components are used:

* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for live documentation and landing pages
* [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) - visual PostgreSQL manager  
* [GeoHealthCheck](https://geohealthcheck.org) to monitor the availability, compliance and QoS of OGC web services
* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) visual Docker monitor and manager

## Production and Sandbox Instance

Two separate server/CM-instances are managed to provide stable/production and 
sandbox/playground environments. As to control changes these instances are mapped to two GitHub repositories:

* https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed for the stable/production instance, nicknamed **Stable**
* https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-sandbox the playground instance, nicknamed **Sandbox**

The **Stable** repo is a so called [GitHub Template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-template-repository) 
from which the **Sandbox** is cloned.
 
*NB initally [GitHub Protected Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) were considered, but*
*it felt that those would be less transparent and even confusing for selective access and chances of mistakes.*

## Selective Redeploy

When changes are pushed to the repo, only the affected services are redeployed.
This is effected by a combination of GitHub Actions and Ansible Playbooks as follows:

* each Service has a dedicated GitHub Action "deploy" file, e.g. [deploy.pygeoapi.yml](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed/tree/main/.github/workflows/deploy.pygeoapi.yml)
* the GitHub Action "deploy" file contains a trigger for a `push` with a `paths` constraint, in this example:

```  
    on:
      push:
        paths:
          - 'services/pygeoapi/**'
``` 

* the GH Action then calls the Ansible Playbook [deploy.yml](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed/tree/main/ansible/deploy.yml) with a `--tags` option related to the Service, e.g. `--tags pygeoapi`
* the [deploy.yml](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed/tree/main/ansible/deploy.yml) will always update the GH repo on the server VM via the `pre_tasks`
* the Ansible task indicated by the `tags` is then executed

## Security

Maintaining a public repository and providing secured access to services can be a challenge.
Complex solutions exist in the Docker space using Docker Secrets, `/etcd` service etc
We tried to keep it simpler, using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) 
and [GitHub Secrets](https://dev.to/n3wt0n/how-secrets-work-in-github-and-how-to-manage-them-p4o) are the two main
mechanisms used for bootstrap and deploy.

The [bootstrap.yml](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed/blob/main/ansible/bootstrap.yml) also applies various Linux hardening components like
IP-blacklisting on multiple login attempt, key-only logine etc.

## Steps and Workflows

Below is a shortened version how 
to setup and maintain a testbed server instance from zero.
In a [dedicated HOWTO](/howto/howto_platform/) 
all steps are expanded/described in very great detail.

### Prerequisites

This is what you need to have available first.

#### Access to a server/VM
This implies acquiring a server/VM instance from a hosting provider.
Main requirements are that server/VM runs an LTS Ubuntu (20.4 or better) and that SSL-keys are available for root access 
(or an admin user account with sudo-rights).

#### Python 3 and Ansible
You need a Python 3 installation and install Ansible and `git` (client).

### Clone template repo

Clone from the template repo: https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed.git.
See [how to do this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

### Setup Ansible

Adapt the files under `git/ansible/vars`, following the README there.

Adapt the inventory file under `git/ansible/hosts`, following the README there.

### Bootstrap the server/VM
"Bootstrap" here implies the complete provisioning of a remote server/VM that runs the operational service stack.
This is a one-time manual action, but can be executed at any time as Ansible actions are idempotent.
By its nature, Ansible tasks will only change the system if there is something to do.

Startpoint is a fresh Ubuntu-server or VM with root access via SSH-keys (no passwords).
The Ansible playbook [bootstrap.yml](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed/tree/main/ansible/bootstrap.yml) installs the neccessary software, and hardens
the server security, e.g. using [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/).
In this step Docker and Docker Compose are installed and a Linux [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) service is run
that automatically starts/stops the operational stack, also on reboots.
The software for the operational stack, i.e. from this repo, is cloned on the server as well.

### Maintain the server/VM
This step is the daily operational maintenance. 
The basic substeps are:

* make a change, e.g. add a data Collection to an OGC API OAFeat service
* commit/push the change to GitHub
* watch the triggered GitHub Actions, check for any errors
* observe changes via website

As indicated, a [dedicated HOWTO](/howto/howto_platform/) describes the above steps in very great detail.
