# Skinning OGC API Features

HTML is a first class citizen in OGC API Common. This means that a typical OGC API can be accessed via a web browser, offering a human readable interface. This aspect brings in a usability aspect that providers previously didn't need to worry about. Aspects such as corporate identity, WCAG (accessibility), search engine optimisation or a cookie/privacy statement.

For the experiment we want to understand how easy it is to update basic aspects on the html visualisation in various OGC API products.

## pygeoapi

pygeoapi uses [jinja templates](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) for html output. These templates are located at `~/pygeoapi/templates`. You can override these templates at their location. But you can also [set a separate template override folder](https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/blob/37b1e9553b29b168b7d5637cc45974ac2681a75f/pygeoapi-config.yml#L45-L46), where you can place (a part of the) updated templates. Updating the templates requires basic html skills, subsituted parameters are placed in curly braces:


```html
  <footer class="sticky">Powered by <a title="pygeoapi" href="https://pygeoapi.io">
    <img src="{{ config['server']['url'] }}/static/img/pygeoapi.png" title="pygeoapi logo" style="height:24px;vertical-align: middle;"/>
    </a> {{ version }}
  </footer> 
```

## pycsw

The implementation of OGC API Records in pycsw is derived from the pygeoapi implementation. The templates are located at `~/pycsw/ogc/api/templates`.

## QGIS

QGIS uses similar jinja templates as pygeoapi, you can override the resources folder via the environment variable QGIS_SERVER_API_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY. The standard location of the templates is `~/qgis/resources/server/api/ogc/templates/wfs3`.

## GeoServer

GeoServer uses [Freemarker templates](https://freemarker.apache.org/) to render content in html. These `.ftl` files are persisted within `.jar` files. A basic override approach could be to extract `gs-ogcapi-features.jar` to a folder, adjust the templates, and zip the package back to a `.jar` file and deploy it. GeoServer also provides a template override mechanism from the data folder. Read more at a [dedicated blog on this topic](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/ogc-api/features/index.html#service-configuration).
 Freemarker uses a similar substitution mechanism as jinja:

```html
  <li>Mail: <a href="mailto:${contact.contactEmail}">${contact.contactEmail}</a></li>
```

To highlight the impact of skinning, we have prepared a tailored skin for geoserver at https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/geoserver/ogc/features. We've added a layout inspired on the GeoNovum website. For this, 2 layout template overrides have been added to `~/data/templates/ogc/features`.

## LDProxy

The HTML encoding is implemented using [Mustache templates](https://mustache.github.io/). Custom templates are supported, they have to reside in the data directory under the relative path `templates/html/{templateName}.mustache`, where `{templateName}` equals the name of a default template (see [source code](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainteractive-instruments%2Fldproxy+extension%3Amustache&type=Code) on GitHub) (taken from [ldproxy docs](https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy/blob/fb772a7c3bc9b32cdde06a1ac92bbb72414b07d1/docs/en/configuration/services/building-blocks/html.md#customization)).

## GeoNetwork

GeoNetwork offers an experimental OGC API Records implementation at https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-microservices/tree/main/modules/services/ogc-api-records. This plugin can be installed on the latest v4 GeoNetwork. GeoNetwork uses [xslt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) to provide a html interface. The xslt templates are located at https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-microservices/tree/main/modules/services/ogc-api-records/src/main/resources/xslt/ogcapir. 

```xml
  <div class="w-2/3 pr-4">
    <abstract>
      <xsl:value-of select="$abstract"/>
    </abstract>
  </div>
```
