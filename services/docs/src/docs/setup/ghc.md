[GeoHealthCheck](https://geohealthcheck.org/) is an availability monitoring solution dedicated to OGC services. Within every test it tries, via a GetCapabilities document, to fetch actual data, to make sure the data is  accessible.

GeoHealthCheck is deployed from https://hub.docker.com/r/geopython/geohealthcheck and uses a PostGreSQL database for persistence.
